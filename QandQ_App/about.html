    <h1>About QandA</h1>
    <p>A simple Question and Answer revision app converted to a web interface using Flask. Source code can be found here: https://github.com/somewun/adt-devops
      This conversion provides a minimal web UI for the same functionality as my orginal app found here: https://github.com/somewun/QandA
    </p>
    <p>Usage notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a CSV file named <code>QandA.csv</code> in the same folder as this script.</li>
      <li>CSV format: ID,Question,Answer (you can include a header row).</li>
      <li>Press Next Q to step through questions, Random Q to jump to a random question, and View Answer to see the answer.</li>
    </ul>
