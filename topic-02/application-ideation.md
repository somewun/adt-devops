# DevOps Pipeline Application Ideation - Student Worksheet

---

## Part 1: Individual Ideation

### Your Application Concept

**1. Basic Description**

What does your application do? (1-2 sentences)

Weather app


Who would use it?

Me

**2. Technical Architecture**

What technology stack are you considering?
- **Language/Framework:** Python and Flask for back end and React for Front end.
- **Database (if needed):** AWS to host the web app???
- **Other components:** VS Code for local version of the files, github for version control , Jenkins for CI/CD??

Application type: 
- [ ] Single page
- [ ] Multi-page 
- [X] API + Frontend 
- [ ] Other: _________

**3. Pipeline Opportunities**

| Pipeline Element | How my application enables this |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Source Control** | VS Code and GitHub |
| | | 
| **Automated Testing** | TBC |
| | | 
| **Build Process** | TBC |
| | | 
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Provision a AWS host server |
| | | 
| **Deployment Automation** | TBC |
| | | 
| **Configuration Management** | TBC |
| | | 
| **Monitoring/Logging** | TBC |
| | | 

**4. Complexity Balance**

Is this simple enough to implement quickly but complex enough to demonstrate learning?

_______________________________________________________________

Confidence in implementing this:
- [ ] Low
- [X] Medium
- [ ] High

Why? _________________________________________________________

## Part 2: Notes from Peer Challenge 

### Strengths Identified

The app is doable and will show things like the config files for the app, we can use github for source control, 



### Risks or Concerns Raised

Tic Tac Toe too simple, not showing enough stuff.

### Suggestions Received

Think more about the pipeline bit.



### Questions That Made Me Think

1. What is the pipeline setup?

2. ____________________________________________________________

3. ____________________________________________________________

### Challenger's Recommendation
- [ ] Proceed as is  
- [X] Proceed with modifications
- [ ] Reconsider the approach

## Part 3: Refinement

### Reflection

**What feedback resonated most with you?**

Keep it simple to make it possible and easy to.


**What will you change about your application idea?**

drop one idea and go for the example weather one.



**What will you keep the same and why?**

The general Idea.

**Do you need to reconsider your entire approach?** ☐ Yes  ☐ No

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

**Technology Stack:**
- Language/Framework: _________________________________________
- Database: _________________________________________
- Other components: _________________________________________

**Key Infrastructure Components:**

## Challenge Questions Reference Sheet

**For when you're the Challenger - use these to help your peer:**

### Pipeline Suitability
- Will your application have enough components to make source control meaningful?
- What will actually be "built" in your build process?
- What can you meaningfully test?
- What infrastructure components will you need to provision?
- How will you demonstrate deployment to different environments?
- What configuration will differ between environments?
- What metrics could you collect from this application?

### Risk Assessment
- Is this ambitious enough to demonstrate advanced DevOps concepts?
- Is this too complex for the time available?
- Are you familiar with this technology stack?
- Can you deliver a working version quickly?
- Will this allow you to address all assessment criteria?

### Your Role as Challenger
Remember: Your job is to help your peer succeed by asking tough questions now, not to criticise their idea. Be constructive and supportive whilst being thorough.

## Next Steps

After completing this exercise:

1. Document your final application idea
2. Confirm your technology stack
3. Plan environment setup
4. Create initial project structure
5. Focus on pipeline, not perfecting the application!

**Note:** You may use AI to generate your application code. This is explicitly permitted (but remember to log those prompts). Focus your time and energy on building an excellent pipeline, not on perfecting the application itself.
