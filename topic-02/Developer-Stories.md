**Developer Stories to be discussed in the presentation of the pipeline**

1) As a code tester the Automation of basic testing allows me to ensure that the code hits a basic level of functionality.
2) As a operations engineer the automation of the deployment ensures that the latest builds of the app are pushed live quickly and efficiently to the ends user.
3) As a developer automation of the process is key to producing more reliable and higher quality end products.
4) As a develpoer the use of a devops pipeline also reduces the amount of human intervention and therefore scope for human error.
5) As a data architect .....
6) As a security developer the standardised process allows for  security to be baked into the process more easily.
7) As a DevOps Engineer deploying the infrastructure as code means that the deployment process is repeatable and reproducable.
8) All, this allows fo r greater more effective monitoring of teh code and security????
