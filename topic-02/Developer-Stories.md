**Developer Stories to be discussed in the presentation of the pipeline**

1.	As a software developer the use of git allows for version control, easier code review and collaboration.
2.	As a developer automation of the process is key to producing more reliable and higher quality end products. (Part of above) As a developer the use of a devops pipeline also reduces the amount of human intervention and therefore scope for human error.
3.	As a code tester the Automation of basic testing allows me to ensure that the code hits a basic level of functionality.
4.	As a DevOps Engineer deploying the infrastructure as code means that the deployment process is repeatable and reproducible.
5.	As a security developer the standardised process allows for security to be baked into the process more easily.
6.	As a data architect using the architecture monitoring tools allow for future improvements to the system.
7.	As an operations engineer the automation of the deployment ensures that the latest builds of the app are pushed live quickly and efficiently to the end user.


All, this allows for greater more effective monitoring of the code and security
