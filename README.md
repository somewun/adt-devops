**ADT DevOps**

Using this Repo to store my Uni work for a DevOps module.  

Current app version: 0.0.2

To Do list:  
  
unit testing scripts - [First Draft written]  
automate the CI/CD in github - Started but needs lots of work still   
automate the deployment to Render 
Developer stories - [First draft written but need refining]  

**Things to do:**

Have a deployed app,  
    - CDeploys to Render - app URL [adt-devops.onrender.com]  
    - Check GitHub settings for secrets - DONE  
    
Ensure the pipeline will have enough features (In the GitHub Actions)  
    - Config management  
    - Unit tests  [First draft written]  
    - Linting  [First draft written]  
    - Logging of tests  

Monitoring  
    - Think about timing the solution?  
    - Render monitoring?  

The app needs to have these built into the app/pipeline to run (tests etc)  


Think about the user (developer) stories for each of these things to start planning for my presentations, extend the stories to show how this benefits the full team and why this is important.  

Email with thoughts/questions on forum/send link to the repository - DONE
