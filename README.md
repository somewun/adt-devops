# ADT DevOps

Using this Repo to store my Uni work for a DevOps module

To Do list:

Wrangler deploy file to run in terminal  
unit testing scripts  
automate the CI/CD in github  
automate the deployment to CloudFlare  


By the 9th:

Have a deployed app,  
Ensure the pipeline will have enough features (In the GitHub Actions)  
    - Config management  
    - Unit tests  
    - linting  
    - Logging of tests  

The app needs to have these built into the app/pipeline to run (tests etc)
