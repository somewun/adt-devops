**ADT DevOps**

Using this Repo to store my Uni work for a DevOps module

To Do list:

Wrangler deploy file to run in terminal - DONE  
unit testing scripts  
automate the CI/CD in github  
automate the deployment to CloudFlare  


**By the 9th:**

Have a deployed app,  
    - Check cloudflare settings for allow urls  
    - Check GitHub settings for secrets (see you tube video)  
    
Ensure the pipeline will have enough features (In the GitHub Actions)  
    - Config management  
    - Unit tests  
    - Linting  
    - Logging of tests  

The app needs to have these built into the app/pipeline to run (tests etc)  


Think about the user (developers) stories for each of these things to start planning for my presentations, extend the stories to show how this benefits the full team and why this is important.
